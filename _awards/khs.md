## 🌍 Global Recognition for Leadership and Vision

Selected from a global pool of over **10,000+ applicants**, I was honored to be named a **Finalist for the 2025 cohort of the Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program at Stanford University** — one of the most competitive and prestigious fellowships in the world, with an acceptance rate of less than **2%**.

The Knight-Hennessy program recognizes individuals for their bold vision to change the world, purposeful leadership, and commitment to impact-driven innovation. Finalists are invited to an immersive finalist experience, including individual and group interviews at Stanford’s Denning House — the hub for one of the most forward-thinking graduate communities on Earth.
