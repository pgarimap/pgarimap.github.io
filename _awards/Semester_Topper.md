## Description

Recognized as the **Semester Topper** among **200 Civil Engineering students** during the seventh semester at **Pulchowk Campus**, Institute of Engineering (IOE), Nepal.

Pulchowk Campus is Nepalâ€™s most competitive engineering college, with an **acceptance rate of just 2.5% nationally**. In 2019, I was selected as one of the **top national performers** in the IOE entrance examination and awarded a **fully-funded government scholarship** for four years of undergraduate study.

I also ranked as the **second-highest female applicant in Nepal** among thousands of aspiring engineers â€“ a reflection of academic dedication, perseverance, and passion for engineering.
