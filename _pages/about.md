 My research focuses on water resources engineering, hydrology, environmental engineering, and energy transition. For Fall 2025, I have been accepted to MS in Environmental Engineering at **Stanford University** and **University of California, Berkeley** (#1 Graduate program for EE).


**Currently:** I am working as a consultant for Oxfam, Nepal for WASH system strengthening of local governments of Nepal. Additionally, I am working on my startup, Paani AI. With Paani AI, we aim to transform the water sector of Nepal through data and innovation.

**My 2030 goal:** I envision reducing the vulnerability of people to the effects of climate change through the **nexus** of **water, energy, and the environment.**
