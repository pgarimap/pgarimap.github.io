title: "Roadmap to reach global net-zero emissions for developing regions by 2085"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/net_zeroemissions
excerpt: " As climate change worsens, the importance of developing regions in reaching net-zero emissions grows, though their contributions have not been thoroughly examined. Our analysis highlights the need for substantial energy system transformations and increased investments, with varying adoption rates of emerging technologies like electric vehicles, hydrogen, and carbon capture across regions, requiring significant financial commitment to achieve a carbon-neutral future by 2085."

## Research Highlights
-  Strategies for achieving net-zero emissions by 2085 in five regions of the global south are analyzed, highlighting the critical need to increase renewable energy consumption fivefold by 2050 while reducing non-renewable energy use by half.
- The majority of investment for decarbonization will be required after 2050, and minor-emitting regions must adopt new technologies at a much faster rate by 2085 to meet these targets.
