## Project Overview

This study focuses on projecting future climate trends for the Gandaki River Basin using outputs from CMIP6 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) coupled with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The scenarios used are SSP24.5 and SSP58.5. 

## Methodology

- **Data Sources:** 
  - CMIP6 GCM outputs
  - Historical climate data for baseline comparison

- **Scenarios:** 
  - SSP24.5 
  - SSP58.5

- **Statistical Methods:**
  - **Downscaling:** Statistical downscaling for efficient computation
  - **Bias Correction:** Quantile Mapping method

- **Analysis:**
  - Comparison of GCM outcomes to historical climate data
  - Focus on precipitation, maximum temperature (Tmax), and minimum temperature (Tmin)
  - Representative meteorological stations: 601, 605, 612, 706, 715, 801, 806, 809, 810, 811, 816, 906, 1007, 1055, and two Tibetan stations

- **Timeframes:**
  - Near-future (NF): 2025-2050
  - Mid-future (MF): 2051-2075
  - Far-future (FF): 2076-2100

## Results

### Precipitation
- **Trend:** Increase in annual precipitation across the Gandaki basin.
- **Scenarios:**
  - **SSP245:**
    - NF: +19%
    - MF: +25%
    - FF: +31%
  - **SSP585:** Similar increasing trend, more pronounced in FF.
- **Visualization:** Refer to Figure 5.13 for detailed projections.

### Temperature
- **General Trend:** Consistent rise in temperatures across all seasons.
- **Maximum Temperature (Tmax):**
  - Significant increases during monsoon (JJAS), pre-monsoon (MAM), and winter (DJF).
- **Minimum Temperature (Tmin):**
  - **MAM Season:**
    - NF: +1.3°C (SSP245), +1.7°C (SSP585)
    - MF: +2.5°C (SSP245), +3.4°C (SSP585)
    - FF: +4.2°C (SSP245), +5.0°C (SSP585)
  - **ON Season:**
    - NF: +1.2°C (SSP245), +1.4°C (SSP585)
    - MF: +2.4°C (SSP245), +3.3°C (SSP585)
    - FF: +2.9°C (SSP245), +5.8°C (SSP585)

## Conclusion

The projected future climate for the Gandaki River Basin indicates significant increases in both precipitation and temperature across different timeframes and scenarios. These projections highlight the need for robust climate adaptation strategies to mitigate potential impacts.
