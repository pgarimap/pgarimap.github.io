## Project Overview

This project evaluates the impact of climate change on agriculture in the 93,700 hectares of irrigable land in the Nawalparasi and Chitwan districts of the Gandaki Basin using the AquaCrop model. 

## Methodology

### Net Irrigation Requirement Assessment
- **Model:** AquaCrop
- **Inputs:**
  - **Climate Data:** Daily rainfall, maximum and minimum air temperatures, sunshine hours, wind speed, and relative humidity for calculating evapotranspiration (ET0) using the ET0 Calculator.
  - **Crop Data:** Types, characteristics, and management practices.
  - **Soil Data:** Type, stratification, depth, and water retention capabilities from Shrestha et al., 2013.
  - **Field Management:** Irrigation schedules and nutrient levels.

### Data Collection
- **Soil Data:** Obtained from Shrestha et al., 2013 using SPAW software.
- **Climatic Data:** Historical data (2025-2099) for SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios from the Nawalparasi climatic station (27.68°N, 84.22°E, 154 MASL). ET0 calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith method.
- **Crop Data:** Based on studies from Shrestha et al., 2013 in Chitwan.

### Model Calibration and Validation
- **Calibration:** Adjusting model parameters to align with observed data using a trial-and-error method.
- **Validation:** Testing model accuracy against new conditions not used in calibration.
- **Conservative Parameters:** Pre-calibrated and validated crop files with parameters constant across various conditions, adjusted using stress response functions.

## Results

### Crop Yield Projections
- **Wheat:** Sustained yield increase in both SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios.
  - **SSP245:** +9.1% yield increase (2025-2050)
  - **SSP585:** +12.53% yield increase (2025-2050)
- **Rice:** Increased yields in both scenarios, with SSP585 outperforming SSP245.
- **Maize:** Significant annual yield volatility in both scenarios, with a decline towards the end of the projection period due to rising monsoon temperatures.

### Conclusion
The study projects increases in wheat and rice yields under both SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, with SSP585 showing consistently higher yields. Maize yields, however, show significant volatility, indicating the need for strategic adaptation measures to ensure stable agricultural production and food security in the region.
