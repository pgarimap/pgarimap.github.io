## Project Overview

This project, conducted in collaboration with the **Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Board (KVWSMB)** and the **Center for Water Resources Studies** at Tribhuvan University, aimed to develop a** gridded temperature dataset** for Nepal spanning the years **2013–2023**. By addressing data scarcity through integrating advanced **interpolation techniques** and **high-resolution datasets**, the project provides a robust resource for **climate modeling and water resource management**. The outputs of this work are critical for understanding temperature distributions and identifying climatic extremes in a region susceptible to climate change.

## Methodology

**Data Collection:** Temperature data (Tmin and Tmax) were sourced from **176 stations** across **Nepal, India, and China**. ERA5 reanalysis datasets supplemented gaps in observational data.

**Data Quality and Bias Correction**: Comprehensive quality checks addressed missing data and bias corrections were applied using elevation-based lapse rates to enhance dataset accuracy.

**Gap Filling:** Missing values were interpolated using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), adjusted for elevation, and validated through cross-validation techniques **(MAE: 0.82°C, RMSE: 1.44°C)**.

**Spatial Interpolation:** Co-kriging, incorporating elevation data from Digital Elevation Models (DEM), generated high-resolution temperature grids. Variograms were modeled to optimize interpolation parameters.

**Climatic Extremes Analysis:** Temperature indices such as TXx (annual warmest daily max temperature) and TNn (coldest daily min temperature) were calculated using CLIMPACT2 software, revealing trends in extreme weather events.

## Results

**Gridded Temperature Surfaces:** High-resolution spatial maps of Tmin and Tmax for Nepal (2013–2023) were generated. These grids provide detailed insights into temperature variability across regions and seasons.
